The goal of this project was to seek and find predefined object autonomously by using a rc car. The rc-car is meant to act like a pet dog.

Parts required:
* rc-car (servos to steer & speed control)
* PixyCam (https://pixycam.com)
* Arduino

PixyCam can save objects shape and color in its memory and can recognize it when it sees it. The data from the pixyCam can be used to control the rc-car's servos. In this example the rc-car first starts looking for the object. Once it finds the object it steers itself close it.
